# DNS Checker

Hey there! Welcome to the DNS Checker project. This nifty little web app lets you peek under the hood of any domain's DNS records. Whether you're troubleshooting, curious, or just love DNS (we won't judge), this tool's got you covered.

## What's This All About?

Ever wondered what's going on behind the scenes when you type a domain name into your browser? That's where DNS comes in, and this checker helps you see all those hidden details. It'll show you:

- A records (IPv4 addresses)
- AAAA records (IPv6 addresses)
- CNAME records (aliases)
- MX records (mail servers)
- NS records (name servers)
- And a bunch more!

## The Cool Stuff We Used

We've whipped up this app using some pretty sweet tech:

- HTML5 (because every website needs a solid foundation)
- CSS3 (to make things pretty)
- JavaScript (to make things happen)
- Vue.js (our JavaScript framework of choice for smooth user experiences)
- Tailwind CSS (for quick and easy styling)
- Google's DNS over HTTPS API (the secret sauce for fetching DNS info)
